Bash is a style for Adium.

h2. How do I get it to work

First, you need git. Then you do the following:

You go to your Adium contact list directory.

@cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Contact\ List@

And then you clone these two repositories

@git clone git://github.com/jao/Bash.ListLayout.git@

@git clone git://github.com/jao/Bash.ListTheme.git@

Then you go to the message style directory.

@cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adium\ 2.0/Message\ Styles@

And clone the this repository,

@git clone git://github.com/jao/Bash.AdiumMessageStyle.git@

After that go to your Adium's Preferences window, and choose the one named Bash in the Appearance tab, and in the Message Style tab.

That should be it.
